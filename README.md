# Deprecated Rust Crates

This repository contains some empty crates that have been renamed. Since [`crates.io`](https://crates.io) does not allow crates to be removed or renamed, we instead published the newly named crates and publish a version update to the old ones that are empty crates with a deprecation message in the README for each crate.
